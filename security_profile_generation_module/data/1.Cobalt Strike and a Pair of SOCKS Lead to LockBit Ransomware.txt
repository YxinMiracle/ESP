Analysis of the attack reveals that threat actors deployed a malicious executable named check.exe in the C:\Users\Public\Music\ directory, with the SHA-256 hash 3F97E112F0C5DDF0255EF461746A223208DC0846BDE2A6DCA9C825D9C706A4E9. The file’s metadata indicates its original name was DiskCheck.exe, confirming it as a trojanized payload. Upon execution, check.exe generated multiple log files (computers.txt, LivePc.txt, DeadPc.txt) and leveraged PowerShell to query Active Directory, exporting details of all domain-enabled systems to AllWindows.csv. Subsequent actions included repeated launches of Task Manager (taskmgr) for system monitoring and manipulation of Group Policy settings via gpedit.msc. The presence of a folder named Lockbit, combined with these TTPs—particularly the AD reconnaissance and abuse of administrative tools—strongly correlates with LockBit ransomware operations, exhibiting hallmark behaviors of a ransomware attack.
