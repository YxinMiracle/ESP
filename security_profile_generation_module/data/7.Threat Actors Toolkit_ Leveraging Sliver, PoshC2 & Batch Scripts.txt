Upon further investigation, we discovered another active PoshC2 open directory with nearly identical batch and executable files to those found on the initial PoshC2 IP. This discovery was made through a simple pivot in Shodan. We retrieved files from this new open directory (185.234.216.64:8000) on two occasions: March 1, 2024, and June 29, 2024. Notably, the latest retrieval contained more files than the first one. However, the most interesting part of the March version of the open directory was the ‘poschc2+user.txt’ file, which we managed to retrieve before it was deleted by the threat actor.
